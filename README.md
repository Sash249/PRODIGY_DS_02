# Task 02 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective
To perform exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset to understand
patterns, relationships, and key factors affecting passenger survival.

## Dataset
- Titanic Dataset (loaded using Seaborn)
- Contains information about passengers such as age, gender, class, and survival status

## Methodology
- Loaded the dataset using Seaborn
- Inspected data structure and summary statistics
- Handled missing values by filling age with median
- Removed columns with excessive missing data
- Visualized key relationships using count plots and histograms

## Exploratory Analysis
- Survival count of passengers
- Survival comparison by gender
- Survival comparison by passenger class
- Age distribution of passengers

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

## Key Insights
- Females had a higher survival rate than males
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive
- Age and passenger class played a significant role in survival outcomes

## Conclusion
Exploratory Data Analysis revealed clear patterns in survival based on gender,
passenger class, and age. These insights highlight the importance of EDA in
understanding real-world datasets before applying machine learning models.
